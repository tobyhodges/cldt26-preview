<p>Using correct names and pronouns (e.g. “she/her”) is important to
setting a tone of respect. Learning these is hard to do quickly, so we
recommend displaying it prominently during the workshop.</p>
<p>In an online workshop, give everyone a moment to update their display
name to reflect how they would like to be addressed.</p>
<p>At an in-person event, we recommend supplying name tags and markers,
or using plain paper to create table-displayed name placards.</p>
<p>Note that pronouns are personal and some participants might prefer
not to share them. Do not force people to share their pronouns.</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>The main objective of this training is to teach you the skills you
need to design and develop an effective lesson, in collaboration with
other members of the community.</p>
<p>During the training, we will introduce the steps you can take to
design and develop a lesson to meet the needs of your target audience,
and give you time to begin implementing those steps during the workshop
itself. By the end of the training, you can expect to have defined an
outline for your whole lesson, and begun filling in a detailed plan for
some of its individual sections. The content you create in the training
will exist as an open source lesson website similar to <a href="https://carpentries.github.io/lesson-development-training/" class="external-link">the
one this training is based on</a>. You should also know how you can
continue building on the lesson and have some plans for how you will
collaborate on the project after the training ends.</p>
<p>We will focus on three main areas:</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="designing-a-lesson">Designing a Lesson<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#designing-a-lesson"></a>
</h3>
<p>Much of the training will discuss a process to incorporate good
practices in lesson design. We will explore how defining the specific
skills you wish to teach early on in the development process provides a
foundation from which you can build a stronger, more impactful
lesson.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="building-a-lesson-website">Building a Lesson Website<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#building-a-lesson-website"></a>
</h3>
<p>Throughout the training, while you design and begin developing the
content of your lessons, we will teach you how to incorporate this into
an organised and accessible website using our lesson infrastructure.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="collaborating-effectively">Collaborating Effectively<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#collaborating-effectively"></a>
</h3>
<p>We believe that lessons are much more likely to succeed, and to
remain useful in the long term, if they are developed collaboratively.
We will spend a little time talking about how you can work together
effectively during this training. To further develop your collaboration
skills after the training, we recommend that you join one of the regular
<em>GitHub Skill-up</em> sessions hosted by The Carpentries.
Participation in those skill-ups is optional but included in your
registration for this training.</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>In order to design an effective lesson, we need a structured approach
with the learner in mind and clearly identified goals. Throughout this
training we will use a modified version of a process for curriculum
design commonly referred to as <em>backward design</em>, described by
Gill Nicholls<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>. Following Nicholls’ paradigm, we begin by
defining exactly what you want your learners to be able to do <em>after
they have completed the lesson/training/course</em>, with the subsequent
stages involving the design and evaluation of content that will directly
help learners meet those stated outcomes. By defining at the beginning
of the process what you want the outcomes to be at the end, you ensure
that your efforts remain focused on those goals as you work.</p>
<p>This training promotes an iterative backward design process where,
after identifying the target audience of our lesson, we</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Define desired learning outcomes.</li>
<li>Design assessments to determine progress towards desired
outcomes.</li>
<li>Write content to lead learners from one of these assessments to the
next.</li>
<li>Assess learner progress towards outcomes during teaching.</li>
<li>(After the break) evaluate how closely the outcomes meet the
objectives.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="the-process-throughout-this-training">The process throughout this training<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-process-throughout-this-training"></a>
</h3>
<p>Note the cyclical nature of the process described above. By the time
you have completed your certification as a Carpentries Lesson Developer,
you will have completed one iteration through this cycle:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Define desired learning outcomes.
<ul>
<li>You will define learning objectives for your lesson as a whole and
for individual sections.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Design assessments to determine progress towards desired outcomes.
<ul>
<li>You will learn about different types of assessment and how they can
give you information about your learners’ progress towards the defined
objectives.</li>
<li>You will design and implement exercises that are appropriate to your
target audience and the skills you want to teach them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Write content to lead learners from one of these assessments to the
next.
<ul>
<li>You will choose examples and a narrative that can help learners gain
insight into the topic of your lesson.</li>
<li>You will begin to write content that is accessible, relevant, and
appropriate for your target audience.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Assess learner progress towards outcomes during teaching.*
<ul>
<li>You will deliver part of your new lesson and gather information
about how effectively it teaches learners what they need to know.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Evaluate how closely the outcomes meet the objectives.*
<ul>
<li>You will revisit your lesson design and content and make plans to
update it, based on your own reflections and the feedback you gathered
from learners.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Teaching the new lesson content is an essential intermediate step in
the process and the steps marked with an asterisk (*) will be completed
after the training, as part of the checkout process for certification
(more on which later). The importance of gathering feedback and
reflecting on teaching experience will be a common refrain throughout
this training.</p>

<p>The Carpentries community develops open source lessons, which can
always be updated and may never be <em>finished</em>. A lesson can
undergo many iterations before it reaches a relatively stable state. To
reflect this, we encourage lesson developers to indicate the status of
their lesson by labelling its progress through a <em>lesson life
cycle</em>:</p>
<figure><img src="../fig/life_cycle.png" alt="Diagram of the life cycle of a lesson in The Carpentries ecosystem. A lesson is proposed at the beginning of the pre-alpha stage. It enters alpha when it is taught for the first time. In beta, it is taught by other instructors. A full release of the lesson is made when it is stable. Pilot workshops take place during the alpha and beta phases." class="figure mx-auto d-block"><div class="figcaption">The life cycle of a lesson</div>
</figure><p>Each life cycle stage indicates the level of maturity of a
lesson:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>pre-alpha</strong>: a first draft of the lesson is still
being constructed.</li>
<li>
<strong>alpha</strong>: the lesson has been/is being taught by the
original authors, but has not been fully tested.</li>
<li>
<strong>beta</strong>: the lesson is ready to be taught by
instructors who have not been significantly involved in its development
to this point.</li>
<li>
<strong>stable</strong>: the lesson has been extensively tested by
the authors and others. It can be considered broadly complete and
unlikely to undergo any drastic changes without warning.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although your lessons will probably remain in pre-alpha throughout

<hr class="half-width">
<p>Given the limited time in a short-format training, it is vital to
define the scope of the lesson, i.e. what people need to know before and
what they will know after the lesson. Thinking carefully about the
target audience will help you with this and with defining desired
learning outcomes (the first step of the lesson design). Prominently
displaying a description of the target audience will also help attract
people with the right motivation and relevant prior knowledge to attend
your workshops.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="expertise">Expertise<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#expertise"></a>
</h3>
<p>One of the most important things we can identify about our target
audience is the level of expertise they will already have in relation to
the skills taught in your lesson. In The Carpentries Instructor Training
curriculum, we describe <a href="https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/02-practice-learning.html#the-acquisition-of-skill" class="external-link">three
different stages of skill acquisition: novice, competent practitioner,
and expert</a> and how these stages directly correlate to the complexity
of <a href="https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/02-practice-learning.html#building-a-mental-model" class="external-link">mental
models</a> these different groups have about a domain/topic.</p>
<p>Briefly, the novice is someone who does not know what they do not
know, i.e., they do not yet know what the key ideas in the domain are or
how they relate, the competent practitioner has enough understanding of
the domain/topic for everyday purposes, and the expert is someone who
can easily handle situations that are out of the ordinary and can
immediately use their prior knowledge or skills when presented with a
new problem in the domain.</p>
<p>When designing a new lesson, it is important to think about the level
of expertise that you expect learners to arrive with for two
reasons:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>It helps to predict what prior knowledge and <a href="https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/02-practice-learning.html#building-a-mental-model" class="external-link">mental
model</a> learners will have of the lesson domain when they arrive. This
can enable you to make progress quickly by
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>working to help learners recall (<em>activate</em>) that prior
knowledge<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>,</li>
<li>building on the conceptual understanding they already have<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> and,</li>
<li>perhaps most importantly, giving you some idea of what
<em>misconceptions</em> they might arrive with. It is vital that
misconceptions are identified and corrected early on, before learners
try to incorporate new knowledge into a broken mental model. (More on
this in <a href="formative-assessment.html">_Designing
Exercises</a>.)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>People at different stages of this process need to be taught
differently. For example, novices will learn more from lessons that
include worked examples and are more tutorial-like i.e. focused on a
specific task, with step-by-step explanations of the process, but
without a lot of extra information that is not directly relevant.
However, the same approach may actually hinder learning for competent
practitioners who may be distracted by a step-by-step explanation of
something they already have the prior knowledge of<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>. For learners at this
level of expertise, lessons which include activities offering learners
the freedom to explore options and develop their own solutions, are
likely to be more effective.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="motivation">Motivation<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#motivation"></a>
</h3>
<p>Furthermore, your lesson will be more effective if it aligns with the
motivations of the target audience. Understanding the wants and needs of
your target audience, what they know already and what kinds of problems
they want to solve, will help you design a lesson that learners can see
the value in. It will give them the impression that taking the lesson
will be worthwhile (called <em>positive expectancies</em> in the
literature).</p>
<p>We will look more at strategies to establish value and build positive
expectancies in the next episode.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="be-specific">Be Specific<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#be-specific"></a>
</h3>
<p>It can be tempting to identify a target audience only in vague terms,
for example by writing that a lesson is aimed at “PhD students” or
“early career researchers”. However, taking the time to focus on real
people, or imagined personae, who represent your target audience will
help you take time to consider the various aspects that can influence
how much someone will learn from your lesson. It will also help you
notice when the assumptions you are making about your target audience
are unreasonable.</p>
<p>Most of all, it will help you stay connected to the fact that <em>you
are not your learners</em>: they will arrive at the lesson with
different priorities, interests, and challenges than your own.</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>A very common challenge encountered in workshops is heterogeneity of
expertise among the audience. When learners arrive at a workshop with a
wide range of previous experience with the topic, it is difficult for
the instructors to keep everyone engaged. Those who arrive with too
little relevant knowledge and experience can struggle to follow the
lesson content at the pace you expect, while those who arrive with too
much are likely to become bored and despondent as their expectation of
learning new skills is not met.</p>
<p>One way to try to guard against this is to publish the description of
your target audience when you advertise a workshop teaching your lesson,
alongside a list summarising the skills and conceptual knowledge you
expect learners to arrive with. Another is to use the information you
have about your target audience to ask questions of potential learners
when they apply/register to join the workshop (like the diagnostic
questionnaire you may have prepared in the exercise above), and use the
answers they give to filter out those who fall outside your intended
audience.</p>
<p>While valuable, this kind of pre-assessment should be approached with
caution: people are often bad at self-assessment i.e. estimating our own
ability to perform a task<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>. We can try to mitigate for this when
designing the questions for a pre-workshop survey, leaving little room
for inaccurate self-assessment to confound the results. But experience
suggests it is very difficult to ensure that every learner in a workshop
falls within the intended audience of a lesson.</p>

additional knowledge, skills, and abilities they will have by the time
they leave: these are the <em>learning outcomes</em> of your lesson. It
can feel strange to jump from one end of the process to the other like
this, but clearly defining your goals early in the lesson development
process is vital. As we will see in this episode, it helps you to
determine the activities, examples, etc. that are appropriate for the
lesson content, and provides a scope for what should and should not be

<section><h2 class="section-heading" id="why-focus-on-skills">Why Focus on Skills?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#why-focus-on-skills"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>To ensure your audience stays motivated, and your lesson feels
relevant to them, we recommend that lessons focus on teaching skills
rather than tools. Lessons should be centred around what you are
empowering learners to <em>do</em>, what will be most beneficial to
them, rather than a list of functions or commands you are teaching them
to use. Placing the emphasis on skills over tools will help you
prioritise key concepts and consider how your lesson can have the
biggest impact on the way learners do their work.</p>
</section><section><h2 class="section-heading" id="learning-objectives">Learning Objectives<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#learning-objectives"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>The desired outcomes (the <em>learning objectives</em>) of a lesson
should be new skills, i.e. things that the learner can do. For the vast
majority of lessons, these will be <em>cognitive skills</em>: things
learners can do with their minds. (Lessons intended to teach other kinds
of skill, such as woodwork, playing a musical instrument, or making
sushi, are probably better suited to a different platform than a static
website.) Cognitive skills cannot be equally easily acquired: before we
can <em>apply</em> concepts and <em>create</em> something new, we must
attain the ability to <em>remember</em> and <em>distinguish</em> between
new concepts. Remembering and distinguishing are also abilities that are
often faster to gain than applying or creating.</p>
<p>We must try to be realistic about how far along this scale we can
move learners during a single workshop/lesson. This is one reason why
the target audience is so important: if we can predict what learners
will know when they arrive at the lesson, we can better define the
outcomes we can expect when they leave.</p>
<p>Defining objectives for a lesson is essential because it allows us to
focus the rest of our time on developing content that is necessary for
learners to reach these goals. It will help us ensure we do not miss
anything important or, conversely, include anything superfluous that
could use up valuable time or distract instructors and learners.</p>

<p>Each objective starts with a verb and describes one (and only one)
skill the learner will obtain.</p>
<p>For objectives to be as helpful as possible, they need to be written
in a way that will allow us to directly observe whether or not a learner
has attained the skills we want them to. This means that the skills
described by our objectives should be measurable: as a general rule,
action verbs such as “explain,” “choose,” or “predict,” are more helpful
than passive verbs such as “know,” “understand,” or “appreciate”, which
are hard to directly assess and are often open to interpretation.</p>
<p>A popular aid for defining learning objectives is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom%27s_taxonomy" class="external-link">Bloom’s
Taxonomy</a>, which divides cognitive skills into several categories.
The original taxonomy arranged these categories in a strict hierarchy,
which has since been disputed. Regardless of whether these skills
conform to such a hierarchy, Bloom’s Taxonomy serves as a very useful
bank of action verbs for use in learning objectives.</p>

<p>To assist you in defining and writing learning objectives for your
lesson, it can be helpful to turn to a popular framework for defining
goals: <em>SMART</em>. Originally <a href="https://community.mis.temple.edu/mis0855002fall2015/files/2015/10/S.M.A.R.T-Way-Management-Review.pdf" class="external-link">proposed

SMART acronym requires goals to be <em>specific</em>,

<strong>S</strong>pecific: they should clearly describe a particular
skill or ability the learner should gain.</li>
<li>
<strong>M</strong>easurable: it should be possible to observe and
ascertain when the learner has developed the skill described in the
objective.</li>
<li>
<strong>A</strong>ttainable: the learner should realistically be
able to acquire the skill in the time available in a workshop or by
following the text of the lesson.</li>
<li>
<strong>R</strong>elevant: they should be relevant to the overall
topic or domain of the lesson as a whole.</li>
<li>
<strong>T</strong>ime-bound: they should include some timeframe
within which the goal will be reached. For learning objectives, this is
built into the approach described above.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that, for any lesson that will be taught in a fixed amount of
time, <em>attainable</em> and <em>time-bound</em> are overlapping:
learning objectives for your lesson will answer the question “What will
learners be able to do by the end of this lesson?” and the time
available to teach the lesson, combined with the expected prior
knowledge of your target audience, will determine how attainable they
are.</p>

<p>Objective 1 is the closest to what we ideally want in a lesson
objective, but it illustrates how difficult it can be to make an
objective truly specific. For example, a more specific and measurable
version of this objective could be:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>write links, headings and bold and italicised text with
Markdown.</em></p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>One of the major challenges of lesson design is choosing what to
include in a lesson: what the main points will be, in what order they
will be introduced, how much detail can be provided, and how much time
can be spent on each point. Especially when writing lessons for short
format training like a Carpentries workshop, difficult decisions often
need to be made about what can and cannot be included. Trying to fit too
much content into a lesson is counter-productive<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>, so it is good to
avoid the temptation to cram in more content than you have time to cover
properly.</p>
<p>Writing learning objectives is a good opportunity to begin thinking
about lesson scope, and can provide assistance when you are faced with a
difficult decision about what content to cut out.</p>
<p>For instance, consider the order in which new skills must be
acquired. Before learners can begin to acquire “higher-level” cognitive
skills to perform creative and analytical tasks, they must first acquire
the foundational knowledge and conceptual understanding of the domain.
Furthermore, these higher-level skills take longer to acquire so, unless
you can expect your target audience to arrive at the lesson with the
relevant foundational knowledge and understanding, it is probably
unrealistic to aim to have learners completing creative tasks before its
end.</p>
<p>As should become clear through activities in the upcoming episodes,
lessons can be broadly considered as blocks of content associated with a
particular learning objective. This can be helpful when making choices
about content to remove, because the task can be considered in the
context of taking out whole learning objectives.</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>We have discussed the importance of defining objectives early in the
lesson design process, and looked at some examples of objectives written
for other lessons. Now it is time to begin defining objectives for your
own lesson.</p>
<p>Here are some recommendations to help you get started:</p>
<ul>
<li>Aim for 3-4 lesson objectives for every 6 hours your lesson will
take to teach. (For example, this curriculum is designed to be taught in
~18 hours and has <a href="index.html#learning-objectives">ten learning
objectives</a>.)</li>
<li>These objectives are for your lesson as a whole: try to define the
“end point” knowledge and skills you want learners to acquire. You can
think of these as the things you would test in a fictional “final exam”
your learners would be able to tackle.</li>
<li>Later you will write “episode-level” objectives that should define
intermediate steps towards the high-level objectives you identify for
your lesson here.</li>

<div class="callout-content">
<p>Write learning objectives for your lesson into the relevant section
of your Lesson Design Notes document - what do you want learners to be
able to do at the end of the workshop? When writing these lesson-level
objectives, try to follow the SMART framework: make them specific,
measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound.</p>
<p>Take notes about the your discussion in your Lesson Design Notes
document. A record of the decisions you made and your reasons for
choosing these objectives can be very helpful for you and others to
understand the design and scope of the lesson later.</p>
<p>If you find yourself writing very specific <em>episode</em> level
objectives, keep them in your notes and try to think of a slightly
broader objective that may contain several very specific objectives. We
will come back and work more on episode objectives next in the
training.</p>

<p>With your high-level lesson objectives set, now is a good time to

<p>Writing your lesson as a story helps learners stay motivated and
engaged, which means they will learn faster<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>. The story you create
can also help learners more easily connect how the skills they are
learning now could be useful after the workshop. You can enable learners
to make connections between what they learn in your lesson and their own
work, by creating a narrative that resembles a situation the learners
might encounter there.</p>
<p>For a lot of lessons developed in The Carpentries community, the
narrative is closely tied to the example data used in the lesson. A good
example dataset makes it easier to teach the relevant skills, helps
learners manage their cognitive load by focusing on what is most
important. Just like the narrative, finding the right dataset involves
striking a balance between authenticity and clarity.</p>

<p>Remember, even if you do not need a dataset for your lesson, you
should decide on a narrative. Building your lesson around a central
example reduces the cognitive load of context switching throughout the
lesson. Using an authentic, yet simple, dataset will also help reduce
cognitive load and help learners to see how they might apply what they
learned to their own projects. It is also important to consider
licensing and ethical considerations when looking for a lesson
dataset.</p>

</div>
<p>So far, you have defined the learning objectives for your lesson as a
whole, and came up with a narrative or example datasets that will help
you tell your story.</p>
<p>Rather than write the lesson as a single, long document, we recommend
that you break it up into chunks like chapters in a book or episodes in
a season of a TV series. This can help manage learners’ cognitive load
by ensuring that you organise content into coherent, more self-contained
chunks, and makes it easier for instructors to schedule regular and
frequent breaks while teaching. Thinking about how content can be broken
down like this early in the lesson design process helps you to consider
the path learners will take to reach your defined objectives, and
identify the component skills and knowledge they will need to pick up on
the way.</p>
<p>In The Carpentries, we refer to these individual parts of a lesson as
<em>episodes</em>, to encourage lesson developers to think about them as
self-contained units (with their own narrative arc) that nevertheless
contribute to the larger whole (the theme or story that runs through a
full season). It also helps to think about the typical length of an
episode: these chunks contain 20-60 minutes of content (teaching +
exercises).</p>
<p>Each episode will exist as a page in the website we will build for
our lessons.</p>
<section><h2 class="section-heading" id="planning-your-episodes">Planning Your Episodes<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#planning-your-episodes"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Before we can start creating the episodes of a lesson, we need to
spend some time planning out the number and order of them. The learning
objectives you defined for your lesson can help with this: at the very
least, it is probably a good idea to have one episode dedicated to each
objective. You might also find that you can “decompose” the lesson-level
objectives into more finely-grained steps that learners can take towards
those end points. For example, the lesson-level objective</p>
<ul>
<li><em>“create formatted page content with Markdown”</em></li>
</ul>
<p>may be broken down into,</p>
<ul>
<li><em>“create bold, italic, and linked text with Markdown”</em></li>
<li><em>“explain the different header levels in Markdown”</em></li>
<li><em>“add images with a caption and alternative text description to a
Markdown document”</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Some questions you might ask yourself to help break down your
lesson-level learning objectives include:</p>
<ul>
<li>What new knowledge and skills will learners need to acquire to be
ready to fulfil the overall objectives for your lesson?</li>
<li>What order should these concepts and skills be introduced in? Are

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Based on the lesson-level objectives and your knowledge of the
lesson topic, divide the lesson up into logical blocks (episodes), that
should each take approximately 20-60 minutes to teach. Think of these

episodes - we will cover that soon.</li>
<li>Next, assign responsibility for one of these episodes to each

<p>Some questions you might ask yourself to help break down your
lesson-level learning objectives include:</p>
<ul>
<li>What new knowledge and skills will learners need to acquire to be
ready to fulfil the overall objectives for your lesson?</li>
<li>What order should these concepts and skills be introduced in? Are
some dependent on others?</li>
<li>If some of these concepts and skills are complex, can they be broken

</ul>
<p>If the length of the list of episodes you create is smaller than the
number of collaborators you have on your team, try assigning two people
to a single episode, with each taking responsibility for a subset of the
objectives defined for that episode. If you plan more episodes than you
have people in your team, do not assign more than one episode to each
collaborator for now, but <strong>we strongly recommend that you assign
yourselves consecutive episodes at the beginning of your
lesson</strong>.</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>Now that we have broken those lesson-level learning objectives into
episodes, we can use the same approach for the individual episodes of a
lesson, defining objectives for the episode to make clear what we intend
to teach in that section. Defining these objectives <em>before writing
the episode content</em> helps us to:</p>
<ul>
<li>stay focused in the episode, without spending time on non-essential
topics</li>
<li>determine whether learners are attaining the skills we wish to teach
them (we will discuss this more in the next two episodes)</li>
<li>summarise the skills the learner can expect to gain by following
this section of the lesson</li>
</ul>
<p>As before, here are some recommendations to help you define these
episode-level objectives:</p>
<ul>
<li>Aim for 2-4 objectives per episode. If you need to write more than
that, consider breaking this section down into multiple episodes.</li>
<li>To ensure your episode content aligns with the overall goals for the
lesson, try to identify which lesson-level objective(s) your episode
will contribute to.</li>
<li>In the context of the previous recommendation, consider how the
objectives for your episode fit as a component of the higher-level
skills/understanding defined in the lesson-level objective(s).</li>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>In order to measure progress and evaluate if and what learning
occurred, we have various types of assessment available to us:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>summative assessments</strong> - used <em>after</em>
instruction to verify whether learners achieved the stated learning
objectives.</li>
<li>
<strong>formative assessments</strong> - used <em>during</em>
instruction to detect changes in learner understanding or performance,
to provide feedback and insight (to both instructors and learners) into
the learners’ developing mental models of the topic taught and to
identify any old or developing misconceptions.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Summative assessments</strong> sum up what learning has been
achieved after training (e.g. via exams). They give valuable data about
learning attainment by individuals and entire cohorts but are not used
to guide further progress of a lesson. They may not be as suitable for
short courses, but may be necessary for those that give marks/grades or
certificates of completion.</p>
<p><strong>Formative assessments</strong> are applied throughout a
course and with several different purposes: they provide a way to move
<a href="https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/05-memory.html#using-formative-assessment-to-support-memory-consolidation" class="external-link">new
information from working memory to long-term memory</a>; they can inform
instructors’ decisions about how to modify instruction to better promote
learning; they also inform learners about changes they may need to make
to improve their learning. Ideally, they should be used often
(e.g. after every 15-20 minutes of teaching), providing opportunities to
instructors to change pace and refocus learners’ attention. For short
courses, formative assessments are usually more valuable and easier to
implement in practice than summative assessments - they need not be
complex or time-consuming, just informative enough about learning for
both instructors and learners.</p>
<p>The most effective way to test learner understanding and progress is
to do such assessments in class - they engage all learners and allow
instructors to check learners’ confidence with the content and its
delivery, can help you deal with any potential misunderstandings as soon
as they arise, and maximise the value of the workshop for everyone. Such
formative assessments also help with <em>metacognition</em> - the
awareness a learner has about how their learning is progressing.</p>
<p>Any instructional tool that generates feedback and is used in a
formative way to check for learners’ understanding can be described as
“formative assessment”. For example,</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>checking in</strong> - gauging learners’ satisfaction and
understanding using agreed signals (e.g. raising different coloured
post-it/sticky notes or <a href="https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/zoom-mechanics/#reactions" class="external-link">Zoom
reactions</a> to indicate that the pace is too fast/slow, or that they
completed/have not completed an exercise).</li>
<li>
<strong>group or collaborative discussions</strong> - raising
questions for discussion among the group. For example, <strong>think,
pair, share</strong>, where learners <em>think</em> individually about
an answer to a question, <em>pair</em> up with a classmate to discuss
their answer, and then <em>share</em> out the consensus they came to
with the class.</li>
<li>
<strong>problem-solving or diagnostic exercises</strong> - setting
(coding or non-coding) challenges for learners to tackle, testing
comprehension of a subject and diagnosing any forming misconceptions
(e.g. via multiple choice questions).</li>
<li>
<strong>individual (guided) reflections</strong> at the end of a
session to help process what was learned, for example asking learners to
write down, draw, or diagram things they learned, noting how things
relate to one another or connect with previous knowledge, things they
want to know more about, and any questions they still have.</li>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>In a simplified model of memory, individuals are equipped with two
types of memory: working (also called short-term) and long-term.
Long-term memory essentially has unlimited storage but is slow to
access, whereas working memory is quicker to access but can only hold a
limited number of items at a time. For teaching, the goal is to help
learners move the new things they’ve learned from working memory into
long-term memory. Exercises help with this by providing learners an
opportunity to practice what was recently learned. Exercises should
occur frequently throughout the lesson to free up working memory and
make space for more new information.</p>
<p>Creating exercises builds upon the learning objectives you created
earlier in the lesson design process. You can design exercises based on
the skills you described in your learning objectives (the learning
outcomes you intend for the lesson). This will be easier if your wrote
learning objectives with specific action verbs. Specific verbs can help
you decide what action you want the learners to perform in the exercise.
E.g. actions such as “explain” and “describe” may be better assessed by
discussions and multiple choice questions, while “solve,” “construct,”
“test” and other higher-level cognitive skills may be better assessed by
debugging tasks, <a href="https://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#code-run" class="external-link">code-and-run</a>,

<p>As you discussed with your group in the last exercise, different
types of learning objectives work better for novices, while others are a
better fit for competent practitioners or experts.</p>
<p>This can be understood in terms of the types of exercises that suit
the objective: exercise types that help manage cognitive load for the
learner, such as <a href="https://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#fill-in-the-blanks" class="external-link">fill-in-the-blanks</a>,
<a href="https://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#faded-examples" class="external-link">faded
examples</a> or <a href="https://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html#parsons-problem" class="external-link">Parsons
problems</a> (which all provide a lot of the guiding process/scaffolding
code and allow the learner to focus on a specific concept or skill) are
a good fit for a novice, to whom all elements of the topic are new.
However, these kinds of exercise do not provide an opportunity for
learners to develop higher-level skills, such as the ability to create
whole new functions or scripts, or to extrapolate from the examples they
have seen to solve a different kind of problem. Indeed, example and
exercise types that are helpful to novices may even be
counter-productive for learners with a greater level of expertise<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Thus you want to choose your objectives to fit your intended audience
and your exercise formats to fit your objectives.</p>

<p><em>“Different types of lesson objectives (LOs) are better fit for
novices, while others are better fit for competent practitioners, etc.
and if exercises (formative assessments) are well aligned to LOs, [they]
will automatically serve the corresponding audience. Thinking in terms
of LOs (What should a learner do in order to achieve this specific LO?
Is this LO exactly what learners are expected to achieve by the end of
this piece of instruction? etc.) is easier than thinking in terms of LOs
+ audience + content. LOs should be tailored to the audience, and, if
this is well done, you may stop worrying about the audience. Create LOs
for the specific audience and create assessments for specific
LOs.”</em></p>

<div class="callout-content">
<p>Using one of the exercise formats you have learned about so far,
design an exercise that will require learners to perform one of the
actions described in the objectives you wrote earlier, and that assesses
their ability to do so.</p>
<p>These should be assessments of the lower-level objectives defined for
individual episodes in the lesson, as opposed to the lesson-level
objectives you wrote first.</p>
<p>Trainees working as a team can choose whether to work together on
discussing and designing a single exercise to assess a single objective,
or to divide their efforts and each focus on an exercise for their own
episode. If you choose to take the latter approach and finish with time
to spare, spend the remainder reviewing and providing feedback on one
another’s assessments.</p>

<p>The same approach to designing exercises within a lesson can also be
used to create a short “pre-assessment” questionnaire for potential
learners to complete when they register for a workshop teaching the
lesson (or for self-evaluation before following the lesson on their
own). You can use <a href="audience.html#defining-prerequisite-knowledge">the list of
prerequisite knowledge that you defined earlier</a> to help with
this.</p>
<p>If you collect the results of this questionnaire, use it to follow up
with people who have registered for the workshop but do not fit the
intended target audience, to manage their expectations about how useful
the workshop will be for them.</p>

<p>You should aim to create all your assessments before you write the
explanatory content of your lesson (recall Nicholls’ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backward_design" class="external-link">backward
design</a>). These assessments will guide your lesson design process by
making sure you know exactly what knowledge you’d expect from your
learners at any point in the lesson.</p>
<p>Well-designed exercises are one of the most valuable resources for an
instructor and any time spent on this during lesson design is well
invested.</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Explanatory text (including examples) help connect your exercises
together into a cohesive lesson. If your exercises are train stations
and scenic views, the explanatory text is the train tracks that connect
them. Often times the examples and exercises may seem like a good draft
for you to teach. However, the explanatory text makes it possible for
other instructors and self-directed learners to follow along by
providing all the relevant information directly in the lesson. It can
also help you remember your goals and stay on track teaching.</p>
<p>How much text to include is often a question of personal style while
balancing the needs of potential users, both other instructors and
learners. You want to find the balance between providing enough
information for learners to meet the learning objectives without
increasing cognitive load with extraneous information. In this section
we will discuss factors to consider when you are writing explanatory
text.</p>
<p>There are trade-offs to consider when preparing a site for use as an
instructional guide vs use as a self-directed learning resource.
Typically, self-directed learning resources are more verbose where
instructional guides are aimed at an audience that can fill in the gaps
on their own. However, very sparse text is less likely to be re-usable
by other instructors as instructors may have different skill levels with
the lesson content or differing mental models. In general, it is not a
good idea to assume others, learners or instructors, will know what you
were thinking when you wrote the content so, if in doubt, be
explicit.</p>

<p>In the Software Carpentry Plotting and Programming with Python Lesson
there is an exercise to load and inspect CSV file for Americas. In the
lesson, before the exercise, the Instructor demonstrates an example of
how to load the data table for another continent (Oceania) and explores
the values with a few different functions. This shows learners how to
call the function to load the CSV into a data frame, and demonstrates
what success looks like for their exercise.</p>
<p>In the Python Interactive Data Visualization Lesson in the Incubator,
there is an exercise to find the correct widget (a slider) for an action
and modify the script to use it. In the lesson, before the exercise, the
instructor introduces a cheatsheet and documentation for interactive
widgets and then creates a dropdown widget for the application. The
slider widget required in the exercise has not been demonstrated but the
preceding example shows all of the necessary steps to add a widget, and
provides the supporting information that learners can consult to
discover how to implement the specific tool.</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>Trying to fit too much content into a lesson is counter-productive.
It is better to cover less and provide a smaller but stable foundation
for learners to build upon.</p>
<p>You should also consider a realistic workshop length for teaching
your lesson. It is difficult to keep learners attentive for many hours
over many days. Most Carpentries workshops are two work days of lesson
material as it is difficult for learners to attend 4 full days of a
workshop. Although, there are some in the community who will run
workshops that are three days to cover additional material.</p>
<p>As you consider the length of your lesson discuss with your
collaborators and ask yourself:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is essential to include?</li>
<li>What can be left out if needed?</li>
<li>Are there checkpoints where the lesson could end if needed?</li>
<li>Can important concepts be moved up earlier to ensure they are
covered?</li>
</ul>
<p>In the end, the only way to know for sure is to teach the lesson,
measuring how long it takes to teach. Borrowing from television, The
Carpentries community calls these early workshops, pilot workshops. As
you run pilot workshops, you can note the length of time spent in each
episode. You might find the <a href="https://codimd.carpentries.org/lesson-pilot-observation-notes-template#" class="external-link">template
for notes on pilot workshops</a> helpful as it includes a table for
episode and exercise timings. Instructors commonly report running short
on time in workshops. Thus, it is better to assume that you are
under-estimating rather than over-estimating the length. It is better to
have additional time for discussion, review, and wrap-up than to rush
through material to fit it into the remaining time.</p>
<p>If, after piloting your new lesson, you find that you did not have
time to cover all the content, approach cutting down the lesson by
identifying which learning objectives to remove. Then take out the
objective(s) and the corresponding assessment(s) and explanatory
content. You may consider making a <a href="https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/02-practice-learning.html#mapping-a-mental-model" class="external-link">concept
map</a> to help identify which objectives depend on one another.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if you decide to keep certain objectives in the
lesson, you can add suggestions on which objectives can be skipped to
the Instructor Notes for the lesson. Instructor Notes are meant to
convey teaching tips and advice to other instructors teaching your
lesson and will be discussed in more detail later on in section <a href="preparing.html">“Preparing to Teach”</a>.</p>
<p>As you add notes and think about what to cut, remember, reducing the
number of lesson objectives can help with managing learner (and
instructor) cognitive load.</p>

as they might not yet understand the learning objectives.</p>
<p>The keypoints wrap up the lesson by providing answers to each of the
questions. Keypoints also help self-directed learners review what they
learned, remind instructors to recap what was covered in an episode, and
help you ensure you answered all the questions you intended for an
episode.</p>

<p>Lessons do not need to be perfected prior to teaching them the first
time. In fact, keeping things relatively basic leaves you some
flexibility while you run through the first few iterations of teaching
the lesson, collecting feedback, and using that to guide
improvements.</p>

something like a stable state, you may find <a href="https://github.com/carpentries-lab/reviews/blob/main/docs/reviewer_guide.md#reviewer-checklist" class="external-link">the

<p>At this stage in the training, you will have gone through the first
three stages of the lesson design. You should have a clear idea of who
the people are that you want to teach this lesson to, and what exactly
the skills are that you want them to learn while they are following it.
You also have an outline of your lesson and its episodes. It is now time
to begin creating a website that will present that lesson to the
world!</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>The source of all The Carpentries lessons is made publicly-available
in repositories on <a href="https://github.com/" class="external-link">GitHub</a>. By making
our repositories public like this, we encourage others to help us
maintain and improve our lessons, and make it as easy as possible for
them to re-use and modify our lessons for their own purposes.</p>
<p>GitHub provides a hosting service to open source projects such as
these, allowing users to present their projects to the wider world. The
repository includes a complete history of the changes made between
versions of the individual files in the project, and provides many
features that facilitate collaboration on projects. We will learn more
about some of those collaborative features later in this training. For
now, we will focus on one other important feature that GitHub provides:
website hosting.</p>
<p>Via a system called <strong>GitHub Pages</strong>, users can build
and host websites from the files present in any repository on GitHub.
For many years, this has been how The Carpentries presents its lesson
websites to the world.</p>

<div id="collapseSpoiler1" class="accordion-collapse collapse" data-bs-parent="#accordionSpoiler1" aria-labelledby="headingSpoiler1">
<div class="accordion-body">
<p>In the past, our lesson sites were generated by software called
<em><a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" class="external-link">Jekyll</a></em>, a tool built into
GitHub Pages that allows the webpage content, written in the text files
of the repository, to be combined with descriptions of settings,
structure, and styling, to create a website. The template used by Jekyll
to structure and style lessons was initially developed in 2013/2014 by
Abby Cabunoc Mayes, Greg Wilson, Jon Pipitone, and Michael Hansen for <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/" class="external-link">Software Carpentry</a>. It was <a href="https://github.com/carpentries/styles/graphs/contributors" class="external-link">expanded
and maintained by many members of the community</a> over almost a
decade, to also support <a href="https://datacarpentry.org/" class="external-link">Data
Carpentry</a>, <a href="https://librarycarpentry.org/" class="external-link">Library
Carpentry</a>, and many other lessons.</p>
<p>In 2022, we adopted a new infrastructure for our lesson sites:
<strong>The Carpentries Workbench</strong>. Lesson sites built on the
Workbench are still hosted with GitHub Pages, but no longer use Jekyll.
Instead, the lessons are built using <a href="https://www.r-project.org/" class="external-link">a programming language,
<em>R</em></a>, and <em><a href="https://pandoc.org/" class="external-link">pandoc</a></em>, a
software designed for converting content between file formats. The
Workbench combines three R packages:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://carpentries.github.io/sandpaper/" class="external-link">sandpaper</a>: converts a collection of Markdown or R
Markdown files into the structure of a lesson website.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://carpentries.github.io/varnish/" class="external-link">varnish</a>: provides the files and folders that add
styling and additional functionality to a lesson website.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://carpentries.github.io/pegboard" class="external-link">pegboard</a>: a programmatic interface to the lesson,
enabling various automated validation tasks.</li>
</ul>
<p>For lesson developers, the Workbench makes The Carpentries lesson
repositories much simpler to navigate and work with.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Developing lessons using the Carpentries Workbench in GitHub might
seem intimidating, especially for those who are less experienced with
collaborative GitHub workflows or unfamiliar with the Workbench.
However, most of the complex infrastructure is hidden from lesson
developers, and some setup tasks only need to be completed once or
infrequently. The table below outlines common tasks that lesson
developers perform in GitHub (which you will learn about shortly) along
with how often they are needed.</p>

<h3 id="creating-a-lesson-repository">Creating a Lesson Repository<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#creating-a-lesson-repository"></a>
</h3>
<p>To get started, we first need to create a new repository for our
lesson. We will use a template to do this, so that the new repository
contains the basic files and folders that the Workbench needs in order
to build a lesson site. There are currently two templates to choose
between:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><a href="https://github.com/carpentries/workbench-template-md/" class="external-link">A
Markdown template</a></li>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/carpentries/workbench-template-rmd/" class="external-link">An
R Markdown template</a>, best suited to lessons you expect to include R
source code that will generate output.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>One member of each participating lesson team</strong> should
choose one of these templates, following the link above and completing
the configuration as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>click on the green “Use this template” button near the top right of
the window</li>
<li>add a name for the repository
<ul>
<li>The name should be descriptive but fairly brief, with hyphens
(<code>-</code>) to separate words</li>
<li>the name can always be changed later, via the repository
settings</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>make sure the “Include all branches” box is checked to copy all
branches from the template repository
<ul>
<li>this is important as lessons are developed in branch
<code>main</code> but rendered into websites from branch
<code>gh-pages</code>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>in the “Description” field, write the title of your lesson</li>
<li>choose “Public” visibility</li>
</ul>
<p>After pressing the <em>Create repository</em> button, you should be
presented with a brand new lesson repository, like in the picture
below.</p>

<p>To be able to add content to the lesson, your collaborators on this
project will need access to the repository. To add collaborators to the
repository, navigate to <em>Settings</em>, then choose
<em>Collaborators</em> from the left sidebar. Now repeat the following
steps for every collaborator working with us on the project.</p>
<ul>
<li>Click <em>Add people</em> and enter the GitHub username of one of
our collaborators.</li>
<li>Click <em>Add USERNAME to this repository</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your collaborator should receive an email inviting them to join the
repository. After they have accepted this invitation, they should be
able to edit the repository, adding new files and modifying existing
ones. Only the person who created the repository will be able to adjust
the repository settings.</p>

more roles with varied permissions.</p>

accompanying files primarily intended for the repository itself rather
than the lesson website. These are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>CITATION.cff</code></li>

<li><code>CONTRIBUTING.md</code></li>

<p>Although we configure GitHub Pages to serve the lesson website from
the <code>gh-pages</code> branch, <strong>the default working branch for
a lesson will be <code>main</code></strong>. For the rest of this
training, you should add and edit files on <code>main</code>, and in
future, when you open Pull Requests to update the lesson content, these
should also be made to <code>main</code>. The <code>gh-pages</code>
branch should never be modified by anyone other than the automated
actions-user account.</p>
<p>To see the rendering of the <code>gh-pages</code> branch by the
automated actions-user, you can click the “Actions” tab from the main
repo page. This tab shows the actions triggered by each commit and if
they are in-progress or completed (sucessfully or with an error). You
can also see the details of actions in more depth by clicking on an
individual commit in this page.</p>

GitHub Pages website” to add the address of your lesson site to the
About box.</p>
<p>After following these steps, when you navigate to the pages URL, you
should see a lesson website with The Carpentries logo and “Lesson Title”
in the top-left corner. You may need to wait a few minutes for the

<p>The lesson title can be adjusted by modifying the
<code>config.yaml</code> file in the repository. The
<code>config.yaml</code> file contains several global parameters for a
lesson - to determine some of the page styling, contact details for the
lesson, etc. <code>config.yaml</code> is written in <em><a href="https://yaml.org/" class="external-link">YAML</a></em>, a structured file format of
key-value pairs in the form <code>key: value</code>. For example, a YAML
file of personal data might include lines such as
<code>name: 'Mei'</code>, <code>height_m: 1.84</code>, and
<code>birthdate: 1899-01-12</code>. As well as the title of the lesson,
you can and should adjust some of the other values in
<code>config.yaml</code>, but you should not need to add new values or
learn a lot about YAML to be able to configure your lesson. You should
also only have to add or modify single-line string values and list
entries, and not deal with multi-line strings or other data types
(e.g. numbers, booleans, dictionaries) that YAML supports. The template
<code>config.yaml</code> aims to guide users through examples and
annotations on how to format the values they provide e.g. if you are
modifying a value wrapped in quotation marks in the template file, it is
safest to replace it with another value within quotation marks.</p>

<h3 class="card-title">Objectives</h3>
<p>After completing this episode, participants should be able to…</p>
<ul>
<li>Add lesson episodes as individual pages of a lesson website.</li>
<li>Use <em>fenced divs</em> to create different structural elements
within a page to format objectives, questions, keypoints, exercises and
their solutions in a lesson website.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Now that we have completed the basic configuration of a lesson site,
it is time to move on and look at where the actual lesson content will
be written.</p>
<p>As we have seen previously, lesson content is composed using Markdown
(or R Markdown), a lightweight markup language that simplifies the
formatting of plain text. While Markdown provides structured elements
like headings, lists, links, images, and code blocks, the Workbench
enhances this by allowing the creation of additional structured text
blocks that visually stand out from standard paragraphs on lesson
websites. These elements, known as <em>fenced divs</em>, will be
demonstrated shortly.</p>
<p>Let’s start by writing our lesson’s home page.</p>
<section><h2 class="section-heading" id="lesson-home-page">Lesson Home Page<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#lesson-home-page"></a>
</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>The “home page” of a lesson is created from the <code>index.md</code>
file: this file should contain a brief introduction to the lesson,
designed to give visitors to the page a first impression of the lesson
and whether it is appropriate for them. The file begins with a short
header, written in the same key-value pair syntax we encountered in
<code>config.yaml</code>.</p>
<div class="codewrapper sourceCode" id="cb1">
<h3 class="code-label">MARKDOWN<i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-left"></i><i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-right"></i>
</h3>
<pre class="sourceCode markdown" tabindex="0"><code class="sourceCode markdown"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">---</span></span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="an">site:</span><span class="co"> sandpaper::sandpaper_site</span></span>
<span id="cb1-3"><a href="#cb1-3" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">---</span></span></code></pre>
</div>
<p>This header configures how the site will be built by
<code>sandpaper</code>, one of the components of The Carpentries
Workbench, and should be left untouched. The page content begins after
the blank line that follows this header.</p>
<p>To get started on this home page, let’s replace the template text in
<code>index.md</code> with the same short description of your lesson you
added to your <code>README.md</code>.</p>
<p>After that, it might be a good idea to add your lesson objectives to
our lesson’s homepage.</p>
<div id="exercise-more-practice-editing-markdown-in-github" class="callout discussion">
<div class="callout-square">
<i class="callout-icon" data-feather="message-circle"></i>

<div class="callout-content">
<p>Add the objectives you defined for your lesson as a bullet list in
the <code>index.md</code> file of your lesson repository.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Below those, let’s add the prerequisite skills you determined earlier
for your lesson. While you can add them as a bullet point list, the
Workbench provides a special formatted block for prerequisites, so they
appear visually distinct on the page.</p>
<div id="fenced-divs" class="callout">
<div class="callout-square">
<i class="callout-icon" data-feather="bell"></i>
</div>
<span class="callout-header">Callout</span>
<div id="fenced-divs" class="callout-inner">
<h3 class="callout-title">Fenced divs</h3>
<div class="callout-content">
<p>Fenced divs are structural elements within the page, which get
rendered in a visually distinct way on the lesson website. Fenced divs
include regular Markdown content surrounded by special tags to mark the
start and the end of such a block.</p>
<p>To mark the beginning of a fenced div, start a line with an opening
tag - at least 3 colon characters followed by a blank character and a
keyword denoting the type of a fenced div you are creating
(<code>::: fenced_div_keyword</code>) . Then you add the Markdown
content of this structural block. Finally, end your fenced div with a
closing tag consisting of at least 3 colons (<code>:::</code>).</p>
<p><a href="https://carpentries.github.io/sandpaper-docs/instructor/component-guide.html#callout-blocks" class="external-link">There
are many types of fenced divs available in the lesson infrastructure</a>
and we will explore most of them in this episode.</p>

<div class="accordion-body">
<p>You might have noticed by now that GitHub provides a preview of
content in Markdown files, and displays an interpreted (“rendered”)
version of Markdown file content by default in its web interface. You
might also notice that the content of <code>index.md</code> is displayed
differently when viewed on GitHub from how it appears on the homepage of
your lesson website: the yaml header mentioned above appears in a
tabular layout on GitHub, but is not visible on the lesson homepage.</p>
<p>This is because the lesson infrastructure accepts an expanded set of
elements in the source Markdown files: syntax for components of a lesson
website that are not part of the standard set of Markdown features,
e.g. page metadata such as the YAML header above, or fenced div blocks
to make certain content visually distinctive. In these cases, you may
see GitHub render the content differently from how it appears on your
website, or not at all.</p>
<p>We will encounter more examples of this throughout the lesson, but
the important thing to remember for now is that <strong>how GitHub
displays source (R) Markdown files is not a reliable indicator of how
content will be displayed in your website</strong>.</p>

<div class="accordion-body">
<p>We have found that trainees bring a wide range of experience with
GitHub to this training. Before teaching the pull request workflow, it
is worth checking how familiar trainees already are with this way of
working.</p>
<p>If all trainees are already comfortable with opening pull requests to
suggest changes to a repository, you can save time by skipping this
section altogether.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>So far, we have been editing the files in our lesson repository
directly. This is a quick way of working and pretty safe for simple and
small changes, especially when your whole lesson team is present (like
in this training). But it has a number of drawbacks:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>There is not much opportunity for quality control: if you make typos
or other mistakes, those will be directly published in your lesson as
soon as the site finishes building.</li>
<li>There is little room for discussion of potential changes.</li>
<li>Only one person can work on a given file at the same time without
risking the introduction of conflicting changes.</li>
</ol>
<p>GitHub offers a workflow for making changes that can be very powerful
for collaborative teams, especially those whose members often work on
the project asynchronously: pull requests. A pull request is a way of
proposing changes to one or more files in a project so that they can be
reviewed, discussed, and adjusted before they are included in the main
version (in our case, the lesson website). It can be helpful to think of
pull requests like the “Suggest changes” feature of collaborative
writing platforms like GoogleDocs.</p>
<p>Pull requests work through a feature of the Git version control
software called <em>branches</em>. A project can have multiple branches,
which each represent a particular state of the project as a whole. We
briefly encountered branches when we were configuring our lesson
repository in the previous episode: when we make changes to the
<code>main</code> branch of the project, the files in that branch are
processed by the lesson build workflows and deposited as webpage source
code into the <code>gh-pages</code> branch, which is then served to the
internet.</p>
<p>When you want to make some more changes to the project, you can
create a new branch to contain those changes before opening a pull
request to propose the inclusion of your changes into the
<code>main</code> version of the project. The pull request interface
then allows your fellow team members to explore and comment on the
changes you propose, and decide whether/when to include them.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="opening-a-pull-request">Opening a pull request<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#opening-a-pull-request"></a>
</h3>
<p>Let’s make another change to the <code>index.md</code>, this time via
a pull request.</p>
<p>To add a “prerequisite” block to <code>index.md</code>, we use a
fenced div called <code>prereq</code> like this:</p>
<div class="codewrapper sourceCode" id="cb2">
<h3 class="code-label">MARKDOWN<i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-left"></i><i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-right"></i>

<span id="cb2-5"><a href="#cb2-5" tabindex="-1"></a>:::</span></code></pre>
</div>
<p>When commiting these changes to the <code>index.md</code>, we can
choose the “Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull
request” option. It can be helpful to choose a descriptive name for the
branch.</p>
<ul>
<li>After pressing “Propose changes”, you will be prompted to open a
pull request.</li>
<li>Choose a title for your pull request, e.g. “Add prerequisites to
index.md” and write a short description of the changes you are
proposing.</li>
<li>After pressing “Create pull request”, your proposed changes will be
presented to your other team members (and anybody else who visits the
project).</li>
</ul>
<p>Team members who have been granted access to the repository as
collaborators will be able to do several things with this pull
request:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Review and comment on the proposed changes, via the “Files changed”
tab of the pull request.</li>
<li>Discuss the pull request in the “Conversation” tab.</li>
<li>

branch of the project to be built into the content of the lesson
website.</li>

<p>The main body of the lesson is written in <em>episodes</em>: the
individual chunks or sections that the lesson is separated into. The
episode pages of the lesson site will be constructed from Markdown or R
Markdown files in the <code>episodes</code> folder of the lesson
repository.</p>
<p>The <code>episodes</code> folder of the new repository contains a
single example episode file, <code>introduction.md</code>. The content
of this file includes some help with and examples of how to write
Markdown files for The Carpentries Workbench. Like
<code>index.md</code>, the episode file begins with a short header. The

(in minutes) required to teach it and complete the exercises.</p>

<p>You may ask each trainee in a lesson team to create an episode file
for the episode they are responsible for. Encourage participants to use
pull requests here, to ensure that they do not create conflicts e.g. by
editing the same file or creating files with identical names. Or ask
them to observe only and not to follow along while you demonstrate this
the first time: they will have an opportunity to practice the steps for
themselves in an upcoming exercise.</p>
<p>It may feel awkward to open separate pull requests for the creation
of an episode file and the addition of that episode to the lesson
navigation, but the cognitive load of teaching how to include changes to
mutiple files in the same branch from within the GitHub web interface
may be too great. Use your judgement of participants’ familiarity and
comfort with GitHub when deciding how to present this and how much
detail to go into. Remember that a separate GitHub Skill-up exists to
teach them a more efficient way of using the platform to work
collaboratively.</p>

<p>You may have noticed a few more fenced divs in the episode file -
<code>questions</code>, <code>objectives</code> and
<code>keypoints</code>. These are all compulsory elements of every
episode - the Workbench will refuse to build your lesson if any of these
are missing.</p>
<p>Now open a new pull request to create a new file in the
<code>episodes</code> folder. Based on the episodes you planned out
earlier, choose a name for your episode that concisely describes the
intended content, e.g. <code>data-visualisation.md</code> (or
<code>data-visualisation.Rmd</code> for a lesson based on R Markdown).
It is vital to include the file extension when naming this file: only
files with the <code>.md</code> or <code>.Rmd</code> extensions will be
built into webpages by the lesson infrastructure.</p>
<p>For the content of your episode, paste everything from the
<code>introduction.md</code> file you copied earlier and:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>replace the title in the header with the title of your episode</li>
<li>set the <code>teaching</code> and <code>exercises</code> fields to

<li>replace the contents of the <code>questions</code> div with the
questions for your episode you defined earlier</li>
<li>replace the contents of the <code>objectives</code> div with the

<li>replace the contents of the <code>keypoints</code> div with the key

<p>After the pull request has been merged and the lesson site has been
rebuilt on GitHub, you should see the episode title appear under
<em>EPISODES</em> in the left sidebar navigation of your lesson site
after refreshing the webpage. Clicking on that title will take you to
the episode page built from the file you created. At the top of the page
body, you will find the episode title and an <em>Overview</em> box
containing a list of the questions and objectives defined for the
episode. At the bottom of the page, you will find the keypoints. Later,
we will add more content to your chosen episodes.</p>

add it to the lesson site navigation. Propose these changes as pull

<p>As we move onto adding more content into trainees’ lesson
repositories, it is quite possible that two or more trainees will be
working on the same episode. This could lead to conflicts if they are
editing the same portion of the episode simultaneously.</p>
<p>Embrace this if it happens in the training! It is a good opportunity
to mention to trainees that this is a common scenario when working
collaboratively and to guide them through steps that need to be taken to
resolve conflicts.</p>
<p>Now may also be a good opportunity to mention that, instead of
editing files on the main branch, it is better when collaborators work
on separate development branches. This enables them to work in parallel
without constantly resolving conflicts and having to deal with them in
the middle of ongoing work. While using branches does not eliminate
conflicts entirely, it delays them until collaborators are ready to
integrate their changes into the main branch. This is done via pull
requests (PRs) - which will be covered later in this episode.</p>

<hr class="half-width">
<p>To create an exercise in The Carpentries Workbench, we use two types
of fenced div:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>challenge</code>, where the main task is a problem to be
solved.</li>
<li>
<code>discussion</code>, where the main task is for participants to
discuss a topic or prompt</li>
</ul>
<p>To start a <code>challenge</code> fenced div, write an opening tag of
at least 3 colons as usual, then follow it with the
<code>challenge</code> keyword. Add the content of the challenge on the
following lines. Finally, close the fenced div using another line with
least 3 colons.</p>
<div class="codewrapper sourceCode" id="cb6">
<h3 class="code-label">MARKDOWN<i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-left"></i><i aria-hidden="true" data-feather="chevron-right"></i>

<span id="cb6-7"><a href="#cb6-7" tabindex="-1"></a>::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::</span></code></pre>
</div>
<p>If you also want to include an expandable solution box for the
challenge you can nest a <code>solution</code> fenced div within the
<code>challenge</code> div. The format is the same as for a challenge
except the fenced div tag is <code>solution</code> instead. Note the
solutions can all be expanded for more accessible reading using the
“Expand All Solutions” option at the top of each episode.</p>
<pre><code>:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge

### Challenge Title

Challenge text, code, and other information goes here

:::::::::::::: solution

### Solution Title

Solution text, code, and other information

:::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
</code></pre>
<p>For readability, you may want to have the length of the closing lines
match the opening lines. See in the above how the challenge and the
nested solution’s closing lines are similar lengths to the their
corresponding opening lines. For more information about creating

<div class="accordion-body">
<p>Often lessons have more content than can be reasonably taught in the
amount of time allotted. This is especially true for collaboratively
developed lessons as each contributor/instructor may have additional
items they’d like to see included, leading to “scope creep”.</p>
<p>To address this issue, in many Carpentries lessons,
<code>spoiler</code> boxes are used for asides and short tangents,
e.g. points that might be relevant to some audiences but are not
essential to the flow of the lesson. These spoilers should still be kept
to a minimum as they can be disruptive to instructors and readers.</p>
<p>Note, this use of the spoiler box is to use the expandable box
functionality as nothing will be “spoiled” by expanding this box. Also,
note that the spoiler box titles should be very clear so instructors
need not expand the spoiler to know if they want to teach that
extra.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>You may notice that many of the older lessons use callouts for both
additional material and to highlight important points interchangeably.
Spoilers were developed in 2023 to help with separating these two
different use cases.</p>
<p>Finally, the Workbench also supports the <code>caution</code> fenced
dev, which can be used to draw attention to common pitfalls, potential
issues or otherwise emphasise something that might negatively impact the
user.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>Sometimes, formatting errors and typos in the files of your
repository can cause the process that builds your lesson website to
fail.</p>
<p>You will likely first notice the failure to build the lesson if the
lesson website is not showing the changes you made. You may also receive
an email from GitHub about the build failure if that is your preferred
way of receiving notifications (but it may take you some time to realise
this). The good thing is that GitHub keeps your previous lesson version
online until the error is fixed and a new build is completed
successfully. If you are not yet familiar with the GitHub interface, it
can be difficult to pinpoint the problem.</p>
<p>Here are some points of advice that you can follow to help find and
fix the problem when you notice the build process fail.</p>
<ul>
<li>When you first notice that there is a problem, <strong>stop</strong>
editing your lesson: any subsequent changes that you make will not be
included in your lesson site until the problem is fixed, and might
introduce additional issues, making it more difficult to find the
original cause.</li>
<li>
<strong>Look at the history</strong> of commits (the link with a
reversing stopwatch icon and “NN commits” at the top of the listing of
files and folders in the repository homepage). Is there a place where
the build has a red cross instead of green circle? If so, click on that
commit to look at the “diff” (where it shows which lines have been
modified). The error is likely to have been introduced by these
changes.</li>
<li>
<strong>Ask for help</strong>: you can open an issue on your
repository and tag a member of The Carpentries team to ask for help
finding the problem. Alternatively, you can also ask for help in The
Carpentries Slack workspace. (More about communication channels for
discussing lesson development coming later in this training.)</li>
<li>Waiting for the GitHub Actions process that builds the website to
run can be tedious, and slow down the process of troubleshooting: it can
take a few minutes for the process to reach the point where it
encounters the problem. It can be helpful to download the files for your
lesson and try to <strong>build a version of the website on your local
computer</strong>, where the build process will be much faster. The
Workbench documentation provides <a href="https://carpentries.github.io/sandpaper-docs/#setup" class="external-link">instructions
for installing the infrastructure</a> and <a href="https://carpentries.github.io/sandpaper-docs/introduction.html#preview" class="external-link">building
a local preview of the lesson website</a>.</li>

</h3>
<p>New versions of the workflows that build your lesson site will be
released occasionally, and the Workbench includes a maintenance workflow
that can help you keep your infrastructre healthy. If you are using R
Markdown source files in your lesson, you will also need to update the
package dependencies of your lesson and the Workbench provides a second
maintenance workflow that can take care of that for you too. Both of
these maintenance workflows will open pull requests on your lesson
repository, which you will need to merge for the updates to be applied.
If your lesson is hosted in The Carpentries Incubator, these workflows
will be configured for you. If you are keeping your lesson repository
somewhere else instead (e.g. with your personal GitHub account or an
organisation of your own), you will need to take care of <a href="https://docs.carpentries.org/resources/curriculum/lesson-forks.html#configure-maintenance-workflows" class="external-link">a

<p>In line with <a href="audience.html">the importance we placed on
evaluation of lesson content earlier in this training</a>, the life
cycle described above places considerable emphasis on the testing of
lessons in <strong>pilot workshops</strong>.</p>
<p>For these pilot workshops to provide an effective evaluation of the
lesson, it is essential to seize the opportunity they provide to collect
feedback and data. For example, a pilot workshop offers a chance to
answer questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>How much time does it take to teach each section of the lesson?</li>
<li>How much time is required for each exercise?</li>
<li>What technical issues were encountered during the lesson?</li>
<li>What questions did learners ask during the workshop?</li>
<li>Which parts of the lesson were confusing for learners?</li>
<li>Which exercises could be improved to provide more information to the
instructors?</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://codimd.carpentries.org/lesson-pilot-observation-notes-template#" class="external-link">The
pilot workshop notes template</a> provides a starting point, but it
takes a lot of time and effort to keep track of all this information
during a pilot workshop. It can be helpful to assign this task to a
member of the lesson development team, who can dedicate themselves to
observing the pilot and taking notes. As soon as the pilot has finished,
it is a good idea to take some time to share the notes with the other
lesson authors, to reflect on and discuss the experience of teaching the
lesson, and to synthesise the lesson notes and any action items that
come from this debrief into specific action items to improve the lesson.
These should be added as new issues on the lesson repository, to help
you keep track of the work that needs doing for the next iteration.</p>
<p>For beta pilot workshops, where the lesson is taught by instructors
who have not yet made a major contribution to its development, it is
vital that instructors have the opportunity before the workshop to learn
about the lesson from the authors, and to debrief with the authors
afterwards so that they can share their experience and observations
about how the lesson could be further improved.</p>

<p>The Carpentries Workbench does not yet support multiple (human)
languages in a single lesson site, e.g. to see the lesson in Spanish and
Afrikaans as well as English. Nevertheless, a thriving subcommunity
exists of people translating/localising lesson content for other
languages and regions, making use of the <a href="https://crowdin.com/" class="external-link">CrowdIn</a> tranlsation platform and <a href="https://carpentries.github.io/sandpaper-docs/episodes.html#callout-blocks" class="external-link">tooling
developed by Joel Nitta</a> that extends the Workbench. To connect with
the internationalisation (often abbreviated to <em>i18n</em>)
subcommunity, join the <code>#internationalisation</code> channel on The
Carpentries Slack workspace. Some of the groups translating lessons to a
particular language meet for regular coworking sessions. These events
are typically listed on the community calendar (linked above).</p>

<p>A teaching plan outlines the structure of your teaching session,
including details, estimated duration and materials needed to deliver
it. For example, a teaching plan may contain the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>welcome, introductions and motivation for the lesson - to introduce
yourself, aims and objectives of the lesson and how it will help
learners</li>
<li>setup - to check if everyone is ready to proceed with the
lesson</li>
<li>segments of teaching and exercises from the lesson and any other
planned activities (e.g. group discussions, wrap-up and feedback)</li>

<p><em>“I usually create detailed notes organised in a concept
map/workflow in order to make everything consistent. I also write next
to each bit of teaching the time approximately needed. For each lesson I
create (and reuse when I teach again the same lesson) very detailed
notes of what happens during the lesson, including teaching goals and
learning objectives I mean to achieve with each bit of lesson. This rich
lesson plan requires a lot of work the first time I teach a lesson, but
reduces a lot the preparation time of future lessons and are super

<p>Figures and other visual aids are great tools to help participants
understand the content being presented and make associations between

<h3 id="setup-instructions">Setup Instructions<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#setup-instructions"></a>

<p>If your lesson requires participants to use any software, tools or
data, it is worthwhile investing time now into creating clear download,
installation and setup instructions for participants to follow and
circulating them ahead of the workshop. This will give you more time at
the pilot for teaching the lesson as troubleshooting setup problems on
the spot can be time-consuming and stressful. Each Carpentries lesson
has a dedicated place for setup instructions within The Carpentries
Workbench located in the file <code>learners/setup.md</code> off the
lesson project root.</p>

<p>Another standard piece of The Carpentries Workbench are the
<em>Instructor Notes</em> pages - intended to help you and other
instructors deliver your lesson by providing useful tips for how to best
run a workshop or explain “sticky” points in the lesson. Instructor
Notes for your lesson are located in the
<code>instructors/instructor-notes.md</code> file off your lesson
project root - this page is displayed in the header menu when in
“Instructor View”.</p>
<p>You may consider adding the following information to your lesson’s
Instructor Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>rationale, strengths and/or weaknesses of the lesson design</li>
<li>what has been tried before and what worked/did not work</li>
<li>tips for teaching the lesson/particular episodes</li>
<li>challenges encountered</li>
<li>troubleshooting common setup/installation/exercise issues</li>
<li>parts that seem to cause trouble or most confusion for learners
(i.e. where to tread carefully, spend more time explaining)</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also add notes in a specific episode of the lesson using
fenced div with tag “instructor”. Instructors can see such notes within
the lesson and the “Instructor Notes” tab in the header menu of the
website by changing the view in the upper right-hand corner of the
lesson to “Instructor View”. These notes are hidden when in ‘Learner
View’</p>
<p>It may initially be difficult to create Instructor Notes until you
have taught the lesson yourself for the first time - but after the first
pilot you will have enough feedback to draft them.</p>

<div class="accordion-body">
<p>The concept of <strong>hidden curriculum</strong> describes
curricular effects that influence learning but are not explicitly
addressed in the lesson content - e.g. (unofficial) social and cultural
norms, behaviours and values that are transferred by instructors to
learners, often unconsciously. These are all the additional things that
people learn about the topic from <em>the way</em> your lesson is
taught, rather than from its official content. It is worthwhile to spend
some time thinking about what learners could pick up from <em>the
way</em> your lesson is taught, as well as from its written content. You
can use Instructor Notes to guide instructors on some of the aspects of
the hidden curriculum of your lesson, e.g. to encourage them to follow
certain tried and tested practices.</p>

</h2>
<hr class="half-width">
<p>There is a lot to collect feedback on when trialling a new lesson and
this is arguably the most important part of your teaching plan. It can
be hard to capture all this information yourself while you are teaching,
hence you will need help from your team - make sure you assign the
feedback collection roles ahead of your pilot. Additionally, when you
are advertising your workshop, try and make it clear to the participants
you are piloting a new lesson and that they will be actively helping you
refine it as well as learning new things themselves. This can help focus
their attention on the feedback you need to collect from them, which you
should be doing:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>constantly and throughout the workshop</strong>
<ul>
<li>As notes taken by an observer/co-instructor - refer to the <a href="operations.html#pilot-workshops">“Pilot Workshops” episode</a> for
suggestions on things to track and the <a href="https://codimd.carpentries.org/lesson-pilot-observation-notes-template#" class="external-link">pilot
workshop notes template</a> and other suggested feedback collection
mechanisms to help you gather such information.</li>
<li>As “minute card” feedback from learners - minute cards are short
comments from learners on what is working well and what could be
improved, provided frequently (e.g. at the end of each session). Like
exercises used as formative assessment, minute card feedback can be
provided by learners while there is still time for instructors to act on
it and adjust their approach. You may find <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1p7iOV5HNvy4POS4g6eottY8RSfKq4kaoKz1-jIFYTMI/template/preview" class="external-link">the

<a href="https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/06-feedback.html#minute-cards" class="external-link">the
Instructor Training curriculum describes how sticky notes can be used at
in-person events</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>at a designated wrap-up and feedback session at the end of
the workshop.</strong> Here, you can cover any other feedback that was
not addressed up to that point and any specific questions you may want
to ask your audience (e.g. about the choice of topics for the lesson,
difficulty level, workshop operations). You may design a special form
that participants can fill in anonymously - here is a <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1OGCQBotD2nOJkc7KpFZLhFfb3EBcxEDwHz_3p48qz3U/template/preview" class="external-link">post-workshop

Incubator. You can use it as a starting point for a post-workshop survey
to be shared with your learners at the end of the pilot workshop and you
can supplement it with additional questions.</li>

<p>Presenting our lesson in front of a ‘real’ audience as a trial run
gave us valuable feedback on things we hadn’t fully considered in the
planning phase. It helped us to better understand how much time is
needed for the exercises, how difficult the exercises are for the
learners and how some examples used can be misunderstood by the
learners. I think that learner feedback is more useful the more the
audience closely matches your own target audience, so the insights are
more practical and relevant for improving the content.</p>

<p>Doing a trial run of our lesson so early in the process felt a bit
intimidating at first, it seemed like we weren’t ready and everything
needed more work. But that’s exactly why the trial run was so helpful.
It gave us a clear picture of what worked and what didn’t, like
realizing we’d packed in way too much content and spotting some
technical issues we hadn’t thought of before. The participants were
understanding and gave us really useful feedback, which made the next
version of the lesson so much better. It was a great reminder that
progress matters more than perfection.</p>

<p>We have reached the end of this training. Throughout this training we
promoted an iterative, collaborative approach to lesson development (as
many other initiatives in The Carpentries community are conducted). The
iterative approach ensures that you regularly receive feedback that will
help you adjust and refine the design and content of your lesson.
Collaboration helps bring different skills and perspectives to a project
and share the load of the work required to bring the project
successfully past the finishing line. For lesson projects, this shared
effort also extends to maintaining and updating the lesson after the
initial development phase.</p>

stable state.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="complete-your-lesson-developer-certification">Complete your Lesson Developer certification!<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#complete-your-lesson-developer-certification"></a>
</h3>
<p>The <a href="checkout.html">checkout process</a> is designed to help
you complete the first cycle through <a href="lesson-design.html">the
iterative backward design process</a>, giving you an opportunity to
deliver some lesson content, gather feedback, and use that information
to evaluate how effective your lesson is in teaching what you want
learners to learn. In addition to making you a certified Lesson
Developer, Checkout will help you identify what could be improved in
your lesson and help you plan the next iteration of development.</p>

</h3>
<p>Trainees with less experience working in GitHub will benefit from
joining a GitHub Skill-up session after this training. The skill-up
teaches good practices and features of the GitHub interface that will
help you manage tasks, review contributions, and work together more
effectively.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="learn-more-about-best-practices-in-lesson-design">Learn more about best practices in lesson design<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#learn-more-about-best-practices-in-lesson-design"></a>
</h3>
<p>Explore the <a href="reference.html#literature-reference-litref">literature
references</a> for this curriculum for greater insight into the
principles underpinning what you learned in the training. The training
has given you a strong foundation but there is a lot more to be learned
about effetive curriculum design and these resources are a great place
to start.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="identify-oustanding-tasks">Identify oustanding tasks<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#identify-oustanding-tasks"></a>
</h3>
<p>This training covers a lot of concepts and leads you through many
different tasks in a limited amount of time. To help you prioritise what
to work on next, consider the following prompts and make notes of your
answers.</p>
<ul>
<li>Which of the exercises set so far in this training did you not have
time to complete?</li>
<li>What do you still need to add/work on?</li>
<li>What can you remove/consider removing?</li>
<li>How will the narrative and example data you have chosen for your
lesson support teaching and assessment?</li>
<li>What diagram or other visual aids could you create/add to supplement
your text?</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="organise-your-knowledge">Organise your knowledge<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#organise-your-knowledge"></a>
</h3>
<p>Take some time to think back on what has been covered so far, then
make some notes on the most important points and actions you want to
take away from that. The Trainers and other participants will not look
at this - it is only for you.</p>
<p>If you do not know where to start, consider the following list for a
starting point:</p>
<ul>
<li>draw a concept map, connecting the material</li>
<li>draw pictures or a comic depicting one or more of the concepts</li>
<li>write an outline of the topics we covered</li>
<li>write a paragraph or “journal” entry about your experience of the
training today</li>
<li>write down one thing that struck you the most</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="assess-your-lesson-design">Assess your lesson design<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#assess-your-lesson-design"></a>
</h3>
<p><em>(This exercise adapted from <a href="reference.html">Via et
al. 2020</a>.)</em></p>
<p>When the first draft of your lesson content is nearly complete,
consider mapping out the relationships between the objectives of your
episode and the examples and exercises via which they will be taught and
assessed. For example,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The read CSV and inspect demo supports Objective 2 (load a simple CSV
data set with Pandas) and will be delivered using participatory live
coding. The objective will be assessed with an exercise that requires
learners to apply the read_csv function to another file and count the
rows in the resulting DataFrame object.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Does any of your planned content not support any learning
objectives?</li>
<li>Is there at least one piece of content planned for each learning
objective?</li>
<li>Is there a formative assessment planned for each learning
objective?</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="add-your-design-notes-to-the-lesson-site">Add your design notes to the lesson site<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#add-your-design-notes-to-the-lesson-site"></a>
</h3>
<p>Consider adding the Design Notes you have been working on as a page
on your lesson site, to provide context for furture discussions of the
intended target audience and scope of the lesson.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Replace the first 13 lines of your Design Notes document with</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>---
title: Lesson Design Notes
---</code></pre>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Save the file to the <code>instructors/</code> directory, and any
images used in the file to the <code>episodes/fig</code> directory.
Adjust the paths to source files for images to begin
<code>episodes/fig/</code>.</li>
<li>Add the filename below <code>instructors:</code> in
<code>config.yml</code> as you did <a href="./infrastructure.html#adding-a-new-episode-to-the-lesson-navigation">for
episode filenames below <code>episodes:</code> previously</a>. For
example, if your file is saved with the name ‘design-notes.md’:</li>
</ol>
<div class="codewrapper sourceCode" id="cb2">

<p>This will make the page accessible from the ‘More’ dropdown in
Instructor View.</p>
